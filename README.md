# Weather_App

* In this assignment we were tasked with creating a page that displayed the weather based on the input from the user.

* I started with the HTML, creating a header with two main columns underneath it that would display the searches and weather.

* When the user puts in a city name the page is then populated with the current weather, a 5 day forecast and an icon describing the weather. 

* By fetching data from the openWeather API I was able to change the text content of certain divs of the page to fill with corresponding data points. But first I needed to fetch the latitutes and longitudes of each city the user entered by using a geolocator API. With that I could update the weather API to get the data needed.
